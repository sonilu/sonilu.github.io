ABSTRACT = {3D terrains used in digital animations and videogames are typically created by several collaborators with a single-user application, which constrains them to update the shared terrain from their PCs, using a turn-taking strategy. Moreover, collaborators have to visualize the terrain through 2D views, confusing novice users when conceiving its shape in 3D. In this article, we describe an architecture for collaborative applications, which allow co-located users to sketch a terrain using their mobile devices concurrently. Two interaction modes are supplied: the standard one and an augmented reality-based mode, which helps collaborators understand the 3D terrain shape. Using the painting with brushesparadigm, users can modify the terrain while visualizing its shape evolution through the camera of their devices. Work coordination is promoted by enriching the 3D space with each collaborator&rsquo;s avatar, which provides awareness information about identity, location, and current action. We implemented a collaborative application from this architecture that was tested by groups of users, who assessed its hedonic and pragmatic qualities in both interaction modes and compared them with the qualities of a similar Web terrain editor. The results showed that the augmented reality mode of our prototype was considered more attractive and usable by the participants.},

title={Towards a Set of Heuristics for Evaluating Chatbots},
volume={19},
url={https://doi.org/10.1109/TLA.2021.9480145},
abstract={Chatbots are artificial intelligence tools that interact with people in different contexts. A chatbot can be useful to streamline daily processes, serve customers 24 hours a day, provide information about classes, among other things. The appearance of new development technologies has made creating a chatbot an increasingly fast and straightforward process, bringing this kind of applications to people who had never considered using them before. However, this speed in development can lead to specific problems, many of them caused by the lack of usability evaluations. Heuristic usability evaluations are user interface review processes carried out by experts and are an essential part of any assessment process. To date, there are no heuristics to evaluate the usability of chatbots. Therefore, this work proposes five usability heuristics in chatbots that come from the experience developing this type of applications, as well as from a broad review of state of the art. The set of heuristics was tested using a case study with the help of five experts, who evaluated an education-oriented chatbot. The results revealed that, although the proposed heuristics need refinement, they are an excellent first step in broadening the horizon of usability evaluations in chatbots.},

ABSTRACT = {Today, social networks are crucial commodities that allow people to share different contents and opinions. In addition to participation, the information shared within social networks makes them attractive, but success is also accompanied by a positive User eXperience (UX). Social networks must offer useful and well-designed user-tools, i.e., sets of widgets that allow interaction among users. To satisfy this requirement, Episodic User eXperience (EUX) yields reactions of users after having interacted with an artifact. Anticipated User eXperience (AUX) grants the designers the capacity to recollect users&rsquo; aspirations, assumptions, and needs in the initial development phase of an artifact. In this work, we collect UX perceived in both periods to contrast user expectations and experiences offered on social networks, in order to find elements that could improve the design of user-tools. We arrange a test where participants (N=20) designed prototypes on paper to solve tasks and then did the same tasks on online social networks. Both stages are assessed with the help of AttrakDiff, and then we analyze the results through t-tests. The results we obtained suggest that users are inclined towards pragmatic aspects of their user-tools expectations.},

abstract={Mobile technologies have increased the interest of industry and academia in providing users with information and services anytime and anywhere. Some services are customized according to the users' characteristics, attempting to create ubiquitous environments that enable such users to share and discover resources. However, research that addresses the creation of these environments is scant. In this article, we go further than single-user pervasive systems, by developing a support that manages shared resources in ubiquitous multi-user environments. Our contribution is a semantic matchmaking service capable of finding the most suitable resources that satisfy the users' requirements. This service processes the users' requests, their context, and the community participating in the resource sharing process, by respecting restrictions, the natural interaction among participants, and the changes that this interaction produces. We model the environment, shared resources, and users as dynamic entities that generate new information, which might affect the availability states of such resources. These states have been defined through the Contextual-Graphs formalism to incorporate new knowledge that can refine, extend, or customize such states, according to the users' habits. Our matchmaking service has been deployed across the Computer Science Department of CINVESTAV-IPN research center, where it has been validated by means of several test cases.},

abstract = {As is well known, the main restriction in mobiles devices is battery duration, so strategies for energy saving in mobile devices should be designed and implemented. In this paper, key considerations in the design of mobile applications are studied from the energy consumption point of view. It has been found that rendering and processing tasks requiring high computational complexity entail increased consumption of energy. Consequently, different techniques, developed at the hardware and operating system levels, have been proposed to improve energy efficiency in mobile devices. On one hand, at the application level, there also exist some approaches, such as Mobile Computation Offloading (MCO) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) design. However, these approaches only consider connectivity and usability problems, putting battery management aspects aside. On the other hand, there are several surveys on saving energy in mobile devices, but many focus on some specific strategies, such as the use of wireless networks or MCO. The main contribution of this work is a literature review, analyzing various strategies for energy saving, emphasizing in those that deal with the development of applications. Unlike other similar articles, we have included several strategies from the literature and those developed and tested by our research group. As shown by our results, the studied strategies prevent energy consumption considerations from affecting other aspects of the application design, such as GUI adaptability and information management.},

title={SymmetricHull: A Convex Hull Algorithm Based on 2D Geometry and Symmetry},
year={2018},
volume={16},
number={8},
pages={2289-2295},
abstract={Thanks to the advances in hardware (sensors and cameras) the number of points that convex hull algorithms must process is now much greater than when these algorithms were developed. This limitation entails focusing current research in convex hull algorithms on finding approaches capable of processing large sets of points. From the many works proposed in this area, the heuristic by Akl-Toussaint deserves a special mention, with outstanding results in execution times. In this article, we take the basic principles of this heuristic to create a convex hull algorithm, called SymmetricHull, that takes advantage of geometric and symmetric properties of the formed quadrants in 2D spaces. The proposed algorithm achieves better exe-cution times than that heuristic, reducing the basic operations to a series of comparisons between consecutive points in an array lexicographically sorted by its y coordinate. SymmetricHull organizes the set of points by quadrants and, instead of using the orientation function as the main operation, it appends the slope s between the analyzed point and its predecessor as a property of the point structure (without causing numerical errors). Point operations can be summarized as follows: 1) a rapid discard of a point, based on its coordinates and the ones of its neighbors; 2) a simple comparison between the property s of the current point and the one of its predecessor in the sorted array, in order to determine whether the current point is a strong candidate to be a part of the convex hull; 3) the addition of a point to a stack of candidates for the convex hull; and 4) the simple elimination of a point from the stack of candidates by comparing the property s of the current point with its predecessors in the stack. Our experiments show that SymmetricHull optimizations achieve good results, in terms of time and number of operations required (multiplications, sums, pushs and pops), being espe-cially efficient with point sets greater than 10^4.},

abstract = {Owing to the dynamic nature of collaborative environments, the software intended to support collaborative work should adapt itself to the different situations that may occur. This requirement is related to the concept of “context of use”, which has been considered as an important aspect in the design of interactive systems. Nevertheless, two main problems about this concept have been identified by current research in context-aware computing: (1) most of the studies have mainly focused on the context of a single user, so the context of multiple users involved in a common endeavor remains little explored, and (2) adaptability in context-aware systems generally takes into account a reduced number of contextual variables (mainly the user’s location and platform). In this paper, we firstly re-conceptualize the notion of “context of use”, in order to consider the main characteristics of collaborative environments. Based on this new notion, we then design and implement a framework that allows application developers to specify the adaptability of groupware systems in terms of the state of activities, roles, collaborators’ location, available resources, and other typical variables of working groups. This framework has been generalized from scenarios that highlight dynamic situations presented in real collaborative settings. Finally, we validate our proposal by a set of applications that are able to adapt their user interface and functionality, when significant changes are produced in the environment, the working group, and/or the used devices.},

abstract = {The importance of mobile groupware systems resides in the specific tasks that they can perform and other systems cannot. On the one hand, groupware systems allow groups of users to work together providing facilities that single-user systems are unable to offer. On the other hand, unlike stationary systems, mobile systems allow users to work on the move. The intersection of these two technologies offers a new support for activities, such as spontaneous collaboration, that could be facilitated neither by stationary groupware systems nor by mobile single-user systems. However, implementations of this new support are uncommon, probably because of the high development effort required and the seemingly little benefit obtained. In this paper, we aim to reduce this effort by facilitating the development of mobile groupware applications that support such activities. Our proposal to achieve this objective involves the design and implementation of the Face-to-Face Mobile Interaction (F2FMI) toolkit, whose goal is to provide generic and reusable software components required in most cases. We expect this strategy to yield a higher variety of successfully deployed applications, which in turn will demonstrate the benefits of supporting this kind of interactions through mobile devices.},

abstract = {Nowadays, organizations include a large number of physical resources (e.g., meeting rooms, classrooms, and auditoriums) and computing ones (e.g., scanners, plotters, and handheld devices) distributed among different offices and buildings. Typically, these resources have to be shared among colleagues, because it is impossible for each collaborator to own private instances of all the different resources present in the organization. In this way, resource sharing gives collaborators the opportunity of not just lending their resources to other collaborators but also benefitting from the usage of resources they do not own. However, finding shared resources in a huge organization, without a proper technological support, can be a challenge for a member of staff and obviously really hard or even impossible for an external person. The main contribution of this paper is a service-oriented architecture called Resource Availability Management Services (RAMS), which is intended to facilitate the development of groupware applications that manage the availability and suitability of human, physical and computing resources. In the case of physical resources, the RAMS architecture allows determining the available resources closest to the requesting collaborator that satisfy his/her requirements and provides information about their physical location and the shortest path to reach them. To accomplish these goals, the proposed architecture relies on the services provided by three main components: (1) a Human Face Recognizer that allows identifying and locating collaborators in an organization, (2) an Ontology-based Matchmaker, which is able to determine a set of available and accessible resources that can satisfy a collaborator’s request, and (3) a Physical Resource Locator that relies on building topologies and the walking distance method to calculate high precision relative distances between collaborators and resources.},

ABSTRACT = {The last decade has seen explosive growth in the technologies required to implement Ambient Intelligence (AmI) systems. Technologies such as facial and speech recognition, home networks, household cleaning robots, to name a few, have become commonplace. However, due to the multidisciplinary nature of AmI systems and the distinct requirements of different user groups, integrating these developments into full-scale systems is not an easy task. In this paper we propose FunBlocks, a minimalist modular framework for the development of AmI systems based on the function module abstraction used in the IEC 61499 standard for distributed control systems. FunBlocks provides a framework for the development of AmI systems through the integration of modules loosely joined by means of an event-driven middleware and a module and sensor/actuator catalog. The modular design of the FunBlocks framework allows the development of AmI systems which can be customized to a wide variety of usage scenarios.},
