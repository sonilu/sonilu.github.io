ABSTRACT = {3D terrains used in digital animations and videogames are typically created by several collaborators with a single-user application, which constrains them to update the shared terrain from their PCs, using a turn-taking strategy. Moreover, collaborators have to visualize the terrain through 2D views, confusing novice users when conceiving its shape in 3D. In this article, we describe an architecture for collaborative applications, which allow co-located users to sketch a terrain using their mobile devices concurrently. Two interaction modes are supplied: the standard one and an augmented reality-based mode, which helps collaborators understand the 3D terrain shape. Using the painting with brushesparadigm, users can modify the terrain while visualizing its shape evolution through the camera of their devices. Work coordination is promoted by enriching the 3D space with each collaborator&rsquo;s avatar, which provides awareness information about identity, location, and current action. We implemented a collaborative application from this architecture that was tested by groups of users, who assessed its hedonic and pragmatic qualities in both interaction modes and compared them with the qualities of a similar Web terrain editor. The results showed that the augmented reality mode of our prototype was considered more attractive and usable by the participants.},

title={Towards a Set of Heuristics for Evaluating Chatbots},
volume={19},

abstract={Chatbots are artificial intelligence tools that interact with people in different contexts. A chatbot can be useful to streamline daily processes, serve customers 24 hours a day, provide information about classes, among other things. The appearance of new development technologies has made creating a chatbot an increasingly fast and straightforward process, bringing this kind of applications to people who had never considered using them before. However, this speed in development can lead to specific problems, many of them caused by the lack of usability evaluations. Heuristic usability evaluations are user interface review processes carried out by experts and are an essential part of any assessment process. To date, there are no heuristics to evaluate the usability of chatbots. Therefore, this work proposes five usability heuristics in chatbots that come from the experience developing this type of applications, as well as from a broad review of state of the art. The set of heuristics was tested using a case study with the help of five experts, who evaluated an education-oriented chatbot. The results revealed that, although the proposed heuristics need refinement, they are an excellent first step in broadening the horizon of usability evaluations in chatbots.},

TITLE = {Measuring Anticipated and Episodic UX of Tasks in Social Networks},

ABSTRACT = {Today, social networks are crucial commodities that allow people to share different contents and opinions. In addition to participation, the information shared within social networks makes them attractive, but success is also accompanied by a positive User eXperience (UX). Social networks must offer useful and well-designed user-tools, i.e., sets of widgets that allow interaction among users. To satisfy this requirement, Episodic User eXperience (EUX) yields reactions of users after having interacted with an artifact. Anticipated User eXperience (AUX) grants the designers the capacity to recollect users&rsquo; aspirations, assumptions, and needs in the initial development phase of an artifact. In this work, we collect UX perceived in both periods to contrast user expectations and experiences offered on social networks, in order to find elements that could improve the design of user-tools. We arrange a test where participants (N=20) designed prototypes on paper to solve tasks and then did the same tasks on online social networks. Both stages are assessed with the help of AttrakDiff, and then we analyze the results through t-tests. The results we obtained suggest that users are inclined towards pragmatic aspects of their user-tools expectations.},

abstract = {Nowadays, organizations include a large number of physical resources (e.g., meeting rooms, classrooms, and auditoriums) and computing ones (e.g., scanners, plotters, and handheld devices) distributed among different offices and buildings. Typically, these resources have to be shared among colleagues, because it is impossible for each collaborator to own private instances of all the different resources present in the organization. In this way, resource sharing gives collaborators the opportunity of not just lending their resources to other collaborators but also benefitting from the usage of resources they do not own. However, finding shared resources in a huge organization, without a proper technological support, can be a challenge for a member of staff and obviously really hard or even impossible for an external person. The main contribution of this paper is a service-oriented architecture called Resource Availability Management Services (RAMS), which is intended to facilitate the development of groupware applications that manage the availability and suitability of human, physical and computing resources. In the case of physical resources, the RAMS architecture allows determining the available resources closest to the requesting collaborator that satisfy his/her requirements and provides information about their physical location and the shortest path to reach them. To accomplish these goals, the proposed architecture relies on the services provided by three main components: (1) a Human Face Recognizer that allows identifying and locating collaborators in an organization, (2) an Ontology-based Matchmaker, which is able to determine a set of available and accessible resources that can satisfy a collaborator’s request, and (3) a Physical Resource Locator that relies on building topologies and the walking distance method to calculate high precision relative distances between collaborators and resources.},

ABSTRACT = {The last decade has seen explosive growth in the technologies required to implement Ambient Intelligence (AmI) systems. Technologies such as facial and speech recognition, home networks, household cleaning robots, to name a few, have become commonplace. However, due to the multidisciplinary nature of AmI systems and the distinct requirements of different user groups, integrating these developments into full-scale systems is not an easy task. In this paper we propose FunBlocks, a minimalist modular framework for the development of AmI systems based on the function module abstraction used in the IEC 61499 standard for distributed control systems. FunBlocks provides a framework for the development of AmI systems through the integration of modules loosely joined by means of an event-driven middleware and a module and sensor/actuator catalog. The modular design of the FunBlocks framework allows the development of AmI systems which can be customized to a wide variety of usage scenarios.},

abstract = {Taking into account the number of works and studies developed, without any doubt, group awareness constitutes one of the keystones for designing and implementing a groupware application. This research focuses on the design and the development of a Group Awareness Knowledge based System (GAKS) whose aim is to provide elaborated and innovative awareness functions to enhance coauthoring of documents on the World Wide Web. The developed advanced awareness functionalities follow and take advantages of the knowledge based system principles to provide: (1) a synchronous/asynchronous contextual communication tool (related to coauthors’ productions and interests), and (2) a detector of physical/logical work proximity that allows users to efficiently produce and coordinate their actions.},
