abstract={A virtual community is a social group of any size that shares common interests and communicates through the Internet. A user joins a virtual community not only because of its popularity or the quality of its contents, but also owing to the user experience that the platform offers. Anticipated User eXperience (AUX) allows knowing the idealisations, hopes, and desires of the users in a very early stage of any development. Participation is a crucial component in the growth and survival of any virtual community. An essential element for people to participate in a virtual community is that the platform should provide suitable user tools, which are widgets that allow users to interact with their peers. We propose an AUX evaluation framework for user tools, whose intention is to improve their design, and through it, the participation of users.},
