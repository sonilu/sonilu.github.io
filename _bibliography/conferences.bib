abstract={Nowadays, an important part of academic education comes from online information, such as class topics, homework, and practices. In this sector, chatbots can be a valuable tool in the teaching/learning process by providing information about courses, procedures, and school services. Thus, the deployment of chatbots in schools and universities starts having a high priority for the academic staff. Nevertheless, most chatbots lack mechanisms to adequately integrate into the educational activities, since they should be useful for teachers, students, and educative assistant personnel (e.g., social workers, psychologists, pedagogues, and prefects). In this article, we propose a chatbot whose primary objective is to serve as an extra-school tool and as an intermediary between teachers and students. In this way, students could express themselves more freely, since the chatbot acts as a bridge with their teachers and other involved personnel. Our prototype was developed as a Web application that provides a text-based user interface and defines several interaction profiles to encompass the specific functions of the different actors in the teaching/learning process. We evaluated the proposed chatbot with the participation of third-year middle school students and teachers. In particular, we measured the workload perceived by our participants after performing a series of tasks. According to our results, our chatbot mostly obtained positive impressions from the test participants.},

abstract={Home security systems are increasingly popular and affordable. Whether DIY solutions with various accessories or simpler proposals, they are a tool that many consider essential for their home. However, these systems are not without problems. An important one is the anxiety and the sensation of siege that can cause, i.e., that users feel insecure inside their own homes. We propose five design guides focused on consistency, through these and with the help of five experts we perform a heuristic evaluation of three popular solutions in the market to try to find the causes that lead to the harmful effects of security systems. Our results reveal that the leading cause of the false siege is the excess of notifications.},

  abstract={Online social networks provide technological support for making up virtual groups of any size, whose members share common interests and interact through the Internet. A person joins a social network not only owing to its popularity and the quality of its contents, but also thanks to the User Experience (UX) that the platform offers. A crucial factor in the growth and survival of any virtual social group is participation, which should be facilitated by suitable user tools supplied by the platform. However, this is not always the case. Anticipated User eXperience (AUX) allows knowing the idealisations, hopes, and desires of the users in a very early stage of any development. In this paper, we propose an AUX and UX evaluation method for user tools of social networks, whose goal is to improve their design, and through it, the participation of people. We tested our method by an experimental design that included the construction of paper prototypes and execution of tasks in actual platforms. The AUX and UX of the participants were measured with AttrakDiff. As shown by our results, based on their previous experience, participants have fixed ideas on the behaviour of user tools, having a visible impact when their expectations are not met.},

  abstract={Social networks are a meeting point on the Internet; people use them to exchange opinions, help each other, or have fun. The growth and success of a social network are multifactorial phenomena but can be generalised into two factors: the quality of the content, and the User eXperience (UX) that the platform offers. Thus, the design of the GUI of a social network must come from the needs of its users. It is necessary to study the UX over time, before and after the development of the platform. Before, the Anticipated User eXperience (AUX) allows knowing the idealisations and desires of users. After, the UX is the measure of the actual system. We propose a UX over time evaluation method for user tools in social networks to have a way to contrast both results, improve the design of user tools, and finally increase participation. To test our evaluation method, we designed an experiment in which users had to devise on paper different user tools. Then, they had to evaluate similar elements but this time in actual social networks. The AUX and UX of the participants were measured with AttrakDiff. Our results show that, based on their previous experience, participants had established ideas on the behaviour of user tools, having a visible impact when their expectations were not met.},

year={2016},
pages={319-326},
abstract={In this paper, we propose a novel groupware that uses Augmented Reality (AR) technology to facilitate the task of collaboratively editing 3D surfaces on mobile devices. In digital animations and video games, 3D surfaces are widely employed to model geometric assets, e.g., mountains on a landscape. However, even if a single surface commonly needs to be created and modified by a group of collaborators, most of the 3D content creation applications are essentially single-user. In addition, 3D surfaces are visualized in 2D projections, causing confusion to new users when imagining their shape in 3D. In our proposal, we use AR technology to help collaborators to easily understand the shape of the surface's 3D representation, and we provide them with the basic editing tools to intuitively modify its shape. In this way, the proposed groupware is able to support a new collaborative setting in which a group of collocated participants, each one using a mobile device, can concurrently modify a surface, while visualizing it in their own real environment by means of AR. In order to support synchronous face-to-face collaboration, we implement an object sharing scheme, which is enough in practice according to the results obtained from tests conducted with groups of collaborators.},

abstract={Dynamic collaborative environments enabled with multiple computational devices, software and files have always had difficulty sharing these resources in a practical way. Traditionally, people involved in environments like those are forced to waste time and energy trying to locate a resource they do not even know if it exists inside the organization. Those resources can be devices, which make collaborators running around buildings, or software, which have to be looked for in huge repositories. Thus, a proper computational support capable of facilitating the task of discovering the most suitable and available resource for a user request is a clear need that remains unsatisfied. Although several works have been developed for resource sharing, the way they find the best match for a request can be highly upgraded, since most of them compare types of resources or minimal technical characteristics in the best case. In this paper, we propose a matchmaking algorithm, whose main goal is to find the best resources available for a request, by considering explicitly stated collaborators' preferences as well as information automatically inferred from the environment and the organization structure.},

abstract={Most of the semantic matchmaking algorithms have been developed for the search of Web Services, since there is a huge need for tools that help taking advantages of services that already exist, but which most of the times are under exploited because their existence remains unknown; thus to promote their usage, matchmaking algorithms are build. However, similar types of solutions for resource discovery in organizations are quasi-inexistent mainly due to the difficulty that represents the management of all the resources available in organizations where human interaction and their implications must be considered. In this paper, we explore an approach to the search of shared resources in collaborative settings by profiting from several principles of the typical semantic matchmaking algorithms. The main contribution of our proposal is to consider people's collaborative context, preferences, and social relationships in order to evaluate their current restrictions when they make a request regarding shared resources. In this way, the users will receive a highly personalized match.},

title={Support for resource aggregation in collaborative P2P systems},
year={2014},
pages={1-6},
abstract={In the last years, usage alternatives of P2P systems have been proposed, in which nodes provide resources and use resources of others in a collaborative way, in order to accomplish high scale tasks. Such systems are called “Collaborative P2P Systems” and have an important role in resource aggregation: advertisement, discovery, selection, matching, and binding phases. However, any toolkit does not allow developers to incorporate resource aggregation support into such systems using a specific programming language. In addition, existent solutions do not achieve cohesion among the key phases of resource aggregation (selection, matching, and binding). The main contribution of this paper is the design and implementation of a novel support that provides cohesion among such key phases and allows developers to aggregate multi-attribute, single-attribute, dynamic, static, and heterogeneous resources into collaborative P2P systems. The proposed Java-based support follows an unstructured topology based on super-peers, which advertise, select, match, and bind resources on behalf of their peers, reducing the network traffic. To validate our proposal, we developed a collaborative P2P application that generates the Mandelbrot set by means of the collaboration of several heterogeneous resources.},

One advantage of this paradigm is to analyze massive amounts of data employing computing resources at different geographic places with different platforms. However in order to harness the power of those resources, many problems must be solved. In this work we deal with the problem of fault tolerance on heterogeneous computer systems. Our proposal aims to ease the process of recovery when system failures are detected at runtime avoiding the necessity for application restarts.

A person working in an organization can be in need of a resource they do not own at any moment, but in a place consisting of multiple buildings that are full of resources (e.g., computer devices, files, software and even people) it can get really hard for such a person to locate or even be sure whether there is a resource or a set of them able to fulfill their request. Some works have been already proposed intended to discover services, but their focus is mainly on applications looking for other applications. Therefore, those proposals do not consider information characterizing real life environment that involves human users, whose conditions are constantly changing (e.g., a person's availability). In this paper, we propose a matchmaking service, which takes a semantic approach for resource discovery in collaborative environments by paying special attention to the effects of human interaction over the availability of resources. The proposed matchmaker has been implemented as a key service of the RAMS Architecture (Resource Availability Management Service) which is able to provide users with a pervasive experience for resource discovery.",

Unlike applications, people expect to receive customized information about their identity, role, social relations, and even contextual variables (e.g., location). Thus, to provide a computational support that satisfies users' requirements in an accurate way, up to date information about the current conditions of the environment and the entities involved in it is fundamental.

However, it could be particularly difficult to take advantages of all these resources without a proper software support capable of discovering the ones that fulfill both a user's requirements and each resource owner's sharing preferences. To try to overcome this problem, several service discovery protocols have been developed, aiming to promote the use of network resources and to reduce configuration tasks. Unfortunately, these protocols are mainly focused on finding resources based just on their type or some minimal features, lacking information about: user preferences, restrictions and contextual variables. To outstrip this deficiency, we propose to exploit the power of semantic description, by creating a knowledge base integrated by a set of ontologies generically designed to be adopted by any type of organization. To validate this proposal, we have customized the ontologies for our case of study, which is a research center.",

abstract={Nowadays, the detection of scars in the cerebral cortex usually involves a manual process performed by neurologists and radiologists. It is a difficult task to carry out, since multiple troubles have to be overcome, from bad calibration of the equipment used to get the cerebral cortex images to several errors, such as spacial and geometrical distortions of MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) sequences. These problems present serious complications in activities such as radiosurgery, which requires high spacial accuracy. Through the implementation of algorithms capable of analyzing MRI sequences, it is possible to automatically detect scars in the cerebral cortex in an easy and successful manner. In addition, the automatic detection of scars decreases the subjectivity of human interpretations and serves as a tool to support diagnoses of diseases. In this paper, a new methodology to automatically detect scars in the cerebral cortex is proposed. The main goal of this methodology is to facilitate the analysis of intensities in T2/MRI sequences by using the region growing and thresholds, as well as artificial neural networks.},

abstract={By means of groupware systems, collaborators can interact in a distributed or co-located way. In our daily activities (at school or office), collaboration usually occurs at the same time and place with the limited help of general purpose-computing applications at best case. In addition, most of these applications are context-unaware, i.e., they are unable of perceiving the group's environment, in order to provide information and services useful for the place, time, people, roles, current activities, and devices involved in such collaboration. Multiple research works have been focused on defining and perceiving changes in the context of use of applications, but most of them only provide support for single-user work. Only few frameworks have been centered on modeling context-aware groupware systems, but they just provide theoretical solutions for distributed group work. In this paper, we propose a framework for facilitating the development of context-aware groupware applications intended for co-located collaboration. The proposed framework has been validated by implementing some applications for meeting activities.},

title={Mechanism for dynamic deployment of plastic mobile cross-platform user interfaces},
year={2011},
pages={1-5},
abstract={New platforms and mobile devices are constantly coming to the market but, in an effort to attract more public, several manufacturers incorporate special features into their models, resulting in a lack of uniformity among them. Thus, devices present different processing, memory, storage, communication and displaying capabilities. This heterogeneity causes that the application development process becomes not homogeneous for all these devices, increasing not only costs but also the possibility of creating inconsistent versions of each application (one for each device). To cope with this problem, we propose to incorporate into the application development process for mobile devices a mechanism to dynamically adapt the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of such applications to changes in the context of use, which is defined in terms of the user, the environment and the platform. Using plasticity as a GUI adaptability technique, we develop a mobile cross-platform mechanism to solve this problem.},

title={An architecture for supporting face-to-face mobile interaction},
year={2011},
pages={1-6},
abstract={A lot of groupware systems for stationary computers have been already developed, but a question remains open: How can we achieve a proportional diversity of this kind of systems for mobile devices? In this paper, we try to answer this question by proposing an architecture for a development toolkit, which aims to provide reusable building tools that facilitate the implementation of mobile groupware systems intended to support collaborative authoring with support for concurrent accesses. The design of the toolkit architecture is motivated by the dificulties found in the development of software for mobile devices, e.g., unexpected network disconnections. Particularly, the proposed tools offer functionality for consistency maintenance of shared information using Operational Transformation, network communication over Bluetooth-based ad-hoc networks, and group awareness support employing an event-based interface.},

title={An architecture to support context of use in groupware systems},
year={2011},
pages={1-6},
abstract={Due to the dynamic nature of collaborative environments, the software for supporting collaborative work (groupware) should adapt itself to the different situations that may occur. This requirement is related to the concept of “Context of Use”, which has been considered as an important element in the design of interactive systems. However, two issues about this concept have been identified by current research in context-aware computing: 1) most of the studies have mainly focused on the context of a single user, so the context of multiple users involved in a common project remains unexplored, and 2) adaptability in context-aware systems generally considers a reduced number of contextual variables (mainly user's location and platform). In this paper, we focus on the context of use from the point of view of collaborative environments, emphasizing the importance of system adaptability depending on the state of projects, organizational policies, physical location of collaborators, available resources and other typical variables of working groups. In order to support and integrate context in groupware, we propose an architecture that is based on real scenarios and situations that serve as a means of validating its functionality.},

year={2011},
pages={1-6},
abstract={Using handwriting as a form of communication with personal devices has recently attained notable popularity owing to the increasing use of touchscreen devices and the tendency to make human-computer interaction more natural. However, as current handwritten character recognition algorithms implement high resource-consuming operations, their use is limited to the development of complex and specific applications, which are not suitable for mobile devices. In fact, such recognition algorithms should consume a small amount of computer resources in order to be used as a common tool to decode data input. In this paper, we propose an algorithm with low resource consumption and high efficiency, which exploits the characteristics of personal mobile devices to recognize handwritten characters in real-time.},

abstract={Sensors are one of the fundamental components of Ambient Intelligence systems. Through sensors AmI systems gather information about the environment, which allows them to assist people in their activities. Depending upon their function and power supply, sensors pose different handling requirements by an AmI system. Interaction with battery powered sensors should be kept to a minimum in order to maximize battery life, while interaction with critical sensors, such as security door sensors, should be as frequent as possible. Additionally, there is a wide array of sensor communication technologies such as X-10, ZigBee, serial and WiFi. To adequately handle the various types of sensors and the different sensor communication forms we propose the use of a uniform sensor-handling scheme. This scheme will enable AmI systems, such as those developed with our Modular Scheme for the Integration of Ambient Intelligence Systems, to handle sensors in a uniform way.},

year={2011},
pages={1-5},
abstract={Public screens can now be found in many places, from shopping malls and airports to museums and restaurants, and even in the outside walls of tall buildings. These public screens usually convey contextual information to the public, and even though some of them support interactivity via touchscreen, the same information is always displayed to all its users regardless of their interests or preferences. On the other hand, mobile devices in general have shown great success by substantially increasing their numbers and their power. As such it is common to start viewing them as tools to achieve previously unattainable capabilities. In this article we engage the idea of using mobile devices to allow multiple users to simultaneously interact with public screens. As a matter of motivation, we consider a few potential applications that range from the marketing to the entertaining industry. We discuss some key characteristics that are desired on a platform that supports this kind of interaction. Finally we present PACMEN, a platform that supports the development of applications oriented to allow multiple users to simultaneously interact with public screens using mobile devices.},

Using groupware applications that are built employing the services of this infrastructure, several users can access and modify replicated shared entities in a consistent and controlled way. PIÑAS provides suited features, such as: user identification, multi-site user definition, user and entity naming, shared entity replication, storage, consistency, and automatic distributed updating. We propose seamless extensions to standard Web services that can be fully integrated within the Web environment. Moreover, the innovative PIÑAS features provide reliable support for temporarily disconnected and nomadic work.},

abstract={Nowadays, due to the development of various research domains such as groupware, multimedia, and WWWamong others, distributed applications require more  real-time capabilities to efficiently transfer monomedia and multimedia information between cooperating sites. In last years, Java became unavoidable for the development of distributed applications.Although the Real-Time Specification for Java (RTSJ) proposereal-time supports, it only remains a suited solution for  specific monoprocesor real-time operating systems. Thus, providing dedicated mechanisms to support Java real-time distributed applications on standard operating systems appears as a main challenge.In this work, we propose a Java-based framework for designing/implementing soft real-time distributed applications. This framework focuses on providing central advantages: first, it is “flexible” because it makes possible to define several scenarios to implement an application. It is adaptable because it is possible toadapt the class structure to satisfy the application requirements.Finally, it defines a dynamic infrastructure that allows clients and servers to exchange components at runtime.},

We start by introducing PI{\~{N}}AS Collaborative Spaces and an extended version of Doc2U, the current tool that implements them, that integrate and structure a suite of specialized project and session services. Later, a set of services for the naming, identification, and shared management of authors, documents and resources in a replicated Web architecture is presented. Finally, a three-tier distributed architecture that organizes these services and a final discussion on how they support a community of authors on the Web is presented.",

abstract="This paper is directly focused on the design of middleware functions to support a distributed cooperative authoring environment on the World Wide Web. Using the advanced storage and access functions of the PI{\~{N}}AS middleware, co-authors can produce fragmented and replicated documents in a structured, consistent and efficient way. However, despite it provides elaborated, concerted, secure and parameterizable cooperative editing support and mechanisms, this kind of applications requires a suited and efficient inter-application communication service to design and implement flexible, efficient, and adapted group awareness functionalities.",

abstract={Collaborative writing systems allow co-authors, spread out across different locations, to work together sharing common documents. One key element that, in most cases, is poorly supported in collaborative writing systems is group awareness. Many research studies have defined several types of group awareness. The paper presents a comparative analysis of workspace and conversational awareness support in collaborative writing systems. For this purpose, we adapted R. Vertegaal's (1997) framework in order to analyze the group awareness mechanisms for collaborative writing. This framework considers the workspace and conversational awareness elements. Based on these elements, we analyzed and compared Quilt, GROVE, PREP, SASSE, Calliope and Alliance collaborative writing systems. Finally, we identified their strengths and weaknesses.},
