abstract={Nowadays, an important part of academic education comes from online information, such as class topics, homework, and practices. In this sector, chatbots can be a valuable tool in the teaching/learning process by providing information about courses, procedures, and school services. Thus, the deployment of chatbots in schools and universities starts having a high priority for the academic staff. Nevertheless, most chatbots lack mechanisms to adequately integrate into the educational activities, since they should be useful for teachers, students, and educative assistant personnel (e.g., social workers, psychologists, pedagogues, and prefects). In this article, we propose a chatbot whose primary objective is to serve as an extra-school tool and as an intermediary between teachers and students. In this way, students could express themselves more freely, since the chatbot acts as a bridge with their teachers and other involved personnel. Our prototype was developed as a Web application that provides a text-based user interface and defines several interaction profiles to encompass the specific functions of the different actors in the teaching/learning process. We evaluated the proposed chatbot with the participation of third-year middle school students and teachers. In particular, we measured the workload perceived by our participants after performing a series of tasks. According to our results, our chatbot mostly obtained positive impressions from the test participants.},

abstract={Home security systems are increasingly popular and affordable. Whether DIY solutions with various accessories or simpler proposals, they are a tool that many consider essential for their home. However, these systems are not without problems. An important one is the anxiety and the sensation of siege that can cause, i.e., that users feel insecure inside their own homes. We propose five design guides focused on consistency, through these and with the help of five experts we perform a heuristic evaluation of three popular solutions in the market to try to find the causes that lead to the harmful effects of security systems. Our results reveal that the leading cause of the false siege is the excess of notifications.},

abstract={Thanks to the hyperconnected world in which we live, we are surrounded by devices. Many of these devices can communicate with each other, and even they can support the same application so that the user can have multiple forms of interaction. However, developers should be careful when considering the control level left to users, since the applications may become unusable. Whether the system or user decides the distribution of the available devices, Graphical User Interface (GUI) consistency must always be preserved. Consistency not only provides users with a robust framework in similar contexts but is an essential learning element and a lever to ensure the GUI efficient usage. This paper proposes a set of consistency guidelines that serve as a means for the construction of multi-device applications. As a case study, DistroPaint was evaluated by experts who identified consistency violations and assessed their severity.},

abstract={The development of interactive environments has led to the creation of useful tools for controlling them. However, developers should be careful when considering the control level left to users, since the applications may become unusable. Whether the system or user decides the distribution of the available devices, Graphical User Interface (GUI) consistency must always be maintained. Consistency not only provides users with a stable framework in similar contexts but is an essential learning element and a lever to ensure the GUI efficient usage. Nevertheless, maintaining GUI consistency in an interactive environment is an open issue.

  abstract={Online social networks provide technological support for making up virtual groups of any size, whose members share common interests and interact through the Internet. A person joins a social network not only owing to its popularity and the quality of its contents, but also thanks to the User Experience (UX) that the platform offers. A crucial factor in the growth and survival of any virtual social group is participation, which should be facilitated by suitable user tools supplied by the platform. However, this is not always the case. Anticipated User eXperience (AUX) allows knowing the idealisations, hopes, and desires of the users in a very early stage of any development. In this paper, we propose an AUX and UX evaluation method for user tools of social networks, whose goal is to improve their design, and through it, the participation of people. We tested our method by an experimental design that included the construction of paper prototypes and execution of tasks in actual platforms. The AUX and UX of the participants were measured with AttrakDiff. As shown by our results, based on their previous experience, participants have fixed ideas on the behaviour of user tools, having a visible impact when their expectations are not met.},

  abstract={Social networks are a meeting point on the Internet; people use them to exchange opinions, help each other, or have fun. The growth and success of a social network are multifactorial phenomena but can be generalised into two factors: the quality of the content, and the User eXperience (UX) that the platform offers. Thus, the design of the GUI of a social network must come from the needs of its users. It is necessary to study the UX over time, before and after the development of the platform. Before, the Anticipated User eXperience (AUX) allows knowing the idealisations and desires of users. After, the UX is the measure of the actual system. We propose a UX over time evaluation method for user tools in social networks to have a way to contrast both results, improve the design of user tools, and finally increase participation. To test our evaluation method, we designed an experiment in which users had to devise on paper different user tools. Then, they had to evaluate similar elements but this time in actual social networks. The AUX and UX of the participants were measured with AttrakDiff. Our results show that, based on their previous experience, participants had established ideas on the behaviour of user tools, having a visible impact when their expectations were not met.},

abstract="To provide efficient support for collaborative writing to a community of authors is a complex and demanding task, members need to communicate, coordinate, and produce in a concerted fashion in order to obtain a final version of the documents that meets overall expectations. In this paper, we present the PI{\~{N}}AS middleware, a platform that provides potential and actual collaboration spaces, as well as specific services customized to support collaborative writing on the Web. We start by introducing PI{\~{N}}AS Collaborative Spaces and an extended version of Doc2U, the current tool that implements them, that integrate and structure a suite of specialized project and session services. Later, a set of services for the naming, identification, and shared management of authors, documents and resources in a replicated Web architecture is presented. Finally, a three-tier distributed architecture that organizes these services and a final discussion on how they support a community of authors on the Web is presented.",

abstract={Collaborative writing systems allow co-authors, spread out across different locations, to work together sharing common documents. One key element that, in most cases, is poorly supported in collaborative writing systems is group awareness. Many research studies have defined several types of group awareness. The paper presents a comparative analysis of workspace and conversational awareness support in collaborative writing systems. For this purpose, we adapted R. Vertegaal's (1997) framework in order to analyze the group awareness mechanisms for collaborative writing. This framework considers the workspace and conversational awareness elements. Based on these elements, we analyzed and compared Quilt, GROVE, PREP, SASSE, Calliope and Alliance collaborative writing systems. Finally, we identified their strengths and weaknesses.},
