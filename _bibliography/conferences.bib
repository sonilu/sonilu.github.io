abstract={Nowadays, an important part of academic education comes from online information, such as class topics, homework, and practices. In this sector, chatbots can be a valuable tool in the teaching/learning process by providing information about courses, procedures, and school services. Thus, the deployment of chatbots in schools and universities starts having a high priority for the academic staff. Nevertheless, most chatbots lack mechanisms to adequately integrate into the educational activities, since they should be useful for teachers, students, and educative assistant personnel (e.g., social workers, psychologists, pedagogues, and prefects). In this article, we propose a chatbot whose primary objective is to serve as an extra-school tool and as an intermediary between teachers and students. In this way, students could express themselves more freely, since the chatbot acts as a bridge with their teachers and other involved personnel. Our prototype was developed as a Web application that provides a text-based user interface and defines several interaction profiles to encompass the specific functions of the different actors in the teaching/learning process. We evaluated the proposed chatbot with the participation of third-year middle school students and teachers. In particular, we measured the workload perceived by our participants after performing a series of tasks. According to our results, our chatbot mostly obtained positive impressions from the test participants.},

abstract={Home security systems are increasingly popular and affordable. Whether DIY solutions with various accessories or simpler proposals, they are a tool that many consider essential for their home. However, these systems are not without problems. An important one is the anxiety and the sensation of siege that can cause, i.e., that users feel insecure inside their own homes. We propose five design guides focused on consistency, through these and with the help of five experts we perform a heuristic evaluation of three popular solutions in the market to try to find the causes that lead to the harmful effects of security systems. Our results reveal that the leading cause of the false siege is the excess of notifications.},

abstract={Thanks to the hyperconnected world in which we live, we are surrounded by devices. Many of these devices can communicate with each other, and even they can support the same application so that the user can have multiple forms of interaction.

  abstract={Online social networks provide technological support for making up virtual groups of any size, whose members share common interests and interact through the Internet. A person joins a social network not only owing to its popularity and the quality of its contents, but also thanks to the User Experience (UX) that the platform offers. A crucial factor in the growth and survival of any virtual social group is participation, which should be facilitated by suitable user tools supplied by the platform. However, this is not always the case. Anticipated User eXperience (AUX) allows knowing the idealisations, hopes, and desires of the users in a very early stage of any development. In this paper, we propose an AUX and UX evaluation method for user tools of social networks, whose goal is to improve their design, and through it, the participation of people. We tested our method by an experimental design that included the construction of paper prototypes and execution of tasks in actual platforms. The AUX and UX of the participants were measured with AttrakDiff. As shown by our results, based on their previous experience, participants have fixed ideas on the behaviour of user tools, having a visible impact when their expectations are not met.},

  abstract={Social networks are a meeting point on the Internet; people use them to exchange opinions, help each other, or have fun. The growth and success of a social network are multifactorial phenomena but can be generalised into two factors: the quality of the content, and the User eXperience (UX) that the platform offers. Thus, the design of the GUI of a social network must come from the needs of its users. It is necessary to study the UX over time, before and after the development of the platform. Before, the Anticipated User eXperience (AUX) allows knowing the idealisations and desires of users. After, the UX is the measure of the actual system. We propose a UX over time evaluation method for user tools in social networks to have a way to contrast both results, improve the design of user tools, and finally increase participation. To test our evaluation method, we designed an experiment in which users had to devise on paper different user tools. Then, they had to evaluate similar elements but this time in actual social networks. The AUX and UX of the participants were measured with AttrakDiff. Our results show that, based on their previous experience, participants had established ideas on the behaviour of user tools, having a visible impact when their expectations were not met.},

abstract={Nowadays, due to the development of various research domains such as groupware, multimedia, and WWWamong others, distributed applications require more  real-time capabilities to efficiently transfer monomedia and multimedia information between cooperating sites. In last years, Java became unavoidable for the development of distributed applications.Although the Real-Time Specification for Java (RTSJ) proposereal-time supports, it only remains a suited solution for  specific monoprocesor real-time operating systems. Thus, providing dedicated mechanisms to support Java real-time distributed applications on standard operating systems appears as a main challenge.In this work, we propose a Java-based framework for designing/implementing soft real-time distributed applications. This framework focuses on providing central advantages: first, it is “flexible” because it makes possible to define several scenarios to implement an application. It is adaptable because it is possible toadapt the class structure to satisfy the application requirements.Finally, it defines a dynamic infrastructure that allows clients and servers to exchange components at runtime.},

The management of shared resources in such an environment raises important technical issues due to the constraints imposed by Web technology. An elaborated group awareness function is provided that allows each author notifying his contributions to other authors, and controlling the way by which other contributions are integrated into his/her environment. In order to support this function, essential to every groupware application, we designed a self-adaptive cooperative environment. We propose a new way of structuring Web documents to be considered as independent resource containers with their corresponding management context. This representation of information simplifies the design of mechanisms to share, modify and update documents and their resources in a consistent and controlled way. Scenarios are used to motivate the need for robust mechanisms for the management of shared Web documents and to illustrate how the extensions presented address these issues.",
